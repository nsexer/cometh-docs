You can manage your in-game rewards in different ways:

### Provide Liquidity

Become a liquidity provider directly with the [LP tokens](./) you get by playing the game!   
You just have to find the matching pool under the [farm](https://swap.cometh.io/#/stake) tab and deposit your LP tokens:

By doing so, you will get a share of the weekly $MUST rewards allocated to the pools.  
By increasing your provided liquidity, you increase your weekly $MUST rewards. To learn more about the liquidity provider rewards take a look [here ](../comethswap-1/comethswap/).

### Remove liquidity

If you don't want to be liquidity provider on ComethSwap, you can also withdraw your LP tokens.  
To do so click on "manage" and "remove" in the Comethswap [Pool](https://swap.cometh.io/#/pool) section:
