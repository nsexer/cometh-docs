### I have an error while trying to mine a comet / jumping?

* Check your must allowance on the bottom left corner of the screen
* Check if you have enough MATIC in your account to pay for the transaction
* Are you sure there are still rewards to be mined? depending on your browser, comets may still appear on the screen but in reality, it has been emptied.
* If none of those work, please [message us on discord](https://discord.gg/NR6nFG59Zy) \(don't forget to copy the transaction error so we can investigate\)
