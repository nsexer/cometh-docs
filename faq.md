### I have an error while trying to mine a comet / jumping ?

* Check you must allowance on the bottom left corner of the screen
* Check if you have enough MATIC in your account to pay for the transaction
* Are you sure there are still rewards to be mined? depending on your browser, comets may still appear on the screen but in reality, it has been emptied.
* Try to change your Metamask RPC from  [https://rpc-cometh-mainnet.maticvigil.com/v1/0937c004ab133135c86586b55ca212a6c9ecd224](https://rpc-cometh-mainnet.maticvigil.com/v1/0937c004ab133135c86586b55ca212a6c9ecd224) to [https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network/](https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network/) following [these instructions](http://docs.cometh.io/game/cometh-bridge/#aa13)
