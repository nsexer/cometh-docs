# Cometh rewards

## 1. Playing the game

### Mining rewards \(Active Income\)

![This ship was able to get lp token directly from the game](../.gitbook/assets/mining%20%281%29.gif)

Cometh is a Game, but not like most other games, it's base on a pay to earn model, also called the Play-to-earn model. It requires some initial investment \(spaceship purchase/renting\) but you will be able to earn substantial rewards by playing.  
  
Comets contain LP \(Liquidity Provider\) Tokens that can be withdrawn or stacked on [ComethSwap](https://swap.cometh.io/#/swap)  
Currently, you can find the following pairs in game :  
**- MUST / WETH :** 0x8826c072657983939c26e684edcfb0e4133f0b3d  
**- MUST / GHST :** 0x70640c8e29561f3704b1014e036baaa46640d0e2  
**- MUST / MATIC :** 0x80676b414a905de269d0ac593322af821b683b92

### Pulling fees \(Passive Income\)

Another way to earn tokens in the Cometh game is the **pulling mechanism**.  
When other players use your ships for a pull, you will get your pulling price in MUST ⚗️, minus 5% \(_the intergalactic toll fee_\).

> 0.0003 is the smallest pulling price currently accepted.  Cometh takes 5% fees on each pull for a minimum of 0.0003.  
> For example, if your pulling price is 0.006 MUST ⚗️ , Cometh will take 0.0003 MUST which corresponds to 5%. You will receive 0.0057 MUST ⚗️ .

This way, you are **generating passive incomes in MUST** ⚗️  ****when you are not playing the game

## 2. [ComethRental](../spaceships/comethrental/)

When you are not playing the game, you can use the rental system to maximize your profits from your spaceships !  
  
You can choose :  
- **Rental price** in MUST ⚗️   
- **Duration**   
- **Pulling rewards** share rate  
- **Mining reward** share rate  
  
Rewards are shared between Spaceship lenders and borrowers. It allows any player to earn rewards without initial investments.
