# Earn & Manage rewards ðŸ’°

You have successfully mined your first comet? Congratulations!

### What rewards?

In Cometh; you can earn rewards in the form of tokens.   
1. By actively playing [the Cometh game](https://game.cometh.io/) and mining comets  
2. By having Spaceships in the Cometh game, you will earn rewards each time players pull on your spaceship  
3. By renting your Spaceships via [ComethRental](../spaceships/comethrental.md)  
4. By farming with your game rewards and tokens on [Comethswap](../comethswap-1/comethswap/)

### 2 types of rewards

1. **Token rewards**: when you mine asteroids charged with single tokens such as **MUST** or **MATIC**, you earn those tokens directly. When you rent spaceships or when someone pull itself to your ships, you earn fixed amounts of token rewards in the form of **MUST.**
2. **LP token mining rewards**: most asteroids are charged with LP tokens such as **MUST / WETH.** Those LP Tokens represent shares \(%\) of liquidity pools on [ComethSwap](../comethswap-1/comethswap/).  They will give you a % of all trades going through those [ComethSwap](../comethswap-1/comethswap/) pools and will allow you to [farm for additional yields](../comethswap-1/comethswap/).
