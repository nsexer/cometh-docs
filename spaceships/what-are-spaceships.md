**Spaceships are vessels capable of mining smart asteroids.**  
  
On the blockchain, spaceships are Non-Fungible Tokens \(NFT\) based on the ERC721 and ERC1155 standards. A spaceship can be pulled in space towards another spaceship in order to get closer to a smart asteroid.  
  
Spaceships can be upgraded with other NFTs such as better drilling tools, engines or crew members that have effects of the spaceship abilities in game.
