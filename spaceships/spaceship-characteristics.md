As stated in [the whitepaper](https://www.cometh.io/cometh-white-paper.pdf), players will soon access perks of their spaceship: the engine, the drill tool and the aura. In the future, crew members will also play a role.

> “The engine of the spaceship can switch between different thrusters varying in colors and dragging the spaceships along the orbit slower or faster. The drill tools are spheres floating around the spaceship that have special effects on the mining such as guaranteed rewards when mining a specific token. The aura of the spaceship impacts the mining efficiency depending on the depletion of the asteroid and the distance to the asteroid.”
