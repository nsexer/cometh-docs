# Rental FAQ

### How are revenues shared? <a id="46fd"></a>

The borrower receives 100% of the reward from pulls.  
The lender and borrower share the mining reward \(according to the terms of the rental contract\).

### What are the fees? <a id="4fc4"></a>

**Protocole Fees**  
5% of Rental price \(with minimum of 0.0003 Must\).  
These fees are used to host the service, fund comets and are redistributed to players.

**Provisioned Exit Fee**  
0.001 Must \* number of ships in the offer.  
These fees ensure that the owner of the ships will get them back from the game at the end of the rental contract.

### Who pays the fees? <a id="c8da"></a>

The borrower.

### What happens at the end of the rental contract?

Nothing, as long as neither party closes the contract, the rental continues.

### Does player statistics include rental statistics? <a id="dca3"></a>

Not yet, but we are working on it.

### Why can’t I rent Rez Ships \(Don’t Buy Meme\)? <a id="96d1"></a>

Rez Ships are based on the 1155 NFT standard. Cometh rental does not support this standard yet.

### Do I have to exit my ships from the game to be able to rent them? <a id="2986"></a>

Yes.

### How to exit my ships from the game? <a id="cc8c"></a>

In [game](https://game.cometh.io/), click on your ship name in the top left corner, and click on “Leave Galaxy”.

### Can we stop a rental before its end date? <a id="8343"></a>

No, unless both players agree to end the contract. Note that this function is not yet available in the UI but it is available in the Renting Contract.

### How do I claim the gain generated during the rental? <a id="21e6"></a>

Lenders or borrowers can claim their earnings at any time during the rental. At the end of the rental \(triggered by the lender or borrower\) the earnings are automatically transferred.
