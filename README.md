[Cometh](https://cometh.io/) is a groundbreaking and evolving strategy game set in a persistent and sustainable space-inspired metaverse powered by Ethereum's blockchain. 

**The Cometh game consists in players mining asteroids to get tokens as rewards.**

Cometh‚Äôs ecosystem leverages Ethereum-based DeFi \(Decentralized Finance\) in a fun and original way to enable players to collect, trade, and earn tokens from ERC-20 protocols, and also NFT‚Äôs unique to the Cometh Metaverse.   
  
On [app.cometh.io](https://app.cometh.io/) you can see applications and tools composing the Cometh Metaverse.
