_If you have_ [_Metamask_](https://metamask.io/) _installed, you won’t have much to do._

### 1. Transfer funds from BSC to Polygon using xPollinate.io <a id="ee64"></a>

You just need to go on [https://www.xpollinate.io/](https://www.xpollinate.io/), the cross chain bridge between BSC and Polygon.

At this time you can only bridge DAI,USDC, USDT… but fees are so low that you can swap on [ComethSwap](http://swap.cometh.io/) for almost nothing.

Connect your Metamask and swap your asset from Binance Smart Chain to Matic Mainnet.

Just as easy, **your assets are now on Polygon**.

### 2. Set up your Metamask RPC on the Polygon Chain <a id="49da"></a>

You now need to set up your Metamask RPC on the Polygon Chain \(Full guide [here](https://medium.com/cometh/how-to-connect-metamask-to-matic-mainnet-rpc-a97e1b79b65f)\)

Good news! You will automatically have some $MATIC in your wallet to make your first transaction on Polygon.

Once it’s done, you just need to go on [swap.cometh.io](http://swap.cometh.io/) and provide LP and farm on ComethSwap.

### 3. [Farm](https://swap.cometh.io/#/stake) triple digits APYs on ComethSwap <a id="e72d"></a>

Head to the [“Farm” section](https://swap.cometh.io/#/stake) and check the Pools you want to farm.

Click on “Add Token-Token liquidity” to provide liquidity to pools you want to farm, with a 1:1 ratio. You will receive a corresponding amount of LP tokens.

Head back to the [“Farm” section](https://swap.cometh.io/#/stake) and deposit the LP tokens you’ve received from previous steps in the corresponding farming pools.

That’s it! You’ve made a cross-chain swaps and you are officially a ComethSwap space farmer. Congrats!
