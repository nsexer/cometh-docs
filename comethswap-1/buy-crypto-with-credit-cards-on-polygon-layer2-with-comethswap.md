Allowing anyone to buy crypto with credit cards is a huge progress for the whole ecosystem. It allows users to purchase crypto with fiat currencies and have the freedom to trade as much as they want at no cost while remaining custodian of their funds.

This is the beauty of decentralized \(ie. non-custodial\) exchanges on Ethereum Layer2 \(ie. fast & low-cost\). Widening the access to those services is a gateway to mainstream crypto adoption, which Cometh aims to pave the way for.
