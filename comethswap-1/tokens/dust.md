# What is DUST

## What is the DUST?

Let‚Äôs start with some incredible milestones we‚Äôve hit over the past 5 months:

* 4,311 spaceships minted
* 4,000 unique players \(+100% in 4 weeks\)
* $200K earned by the top 10 players
* ~450 stakers, $1.6M of TVL

## New tube, New features <a id="a97e"></a>

**Re-built on Polygon to be more accessible**

From day 1, we wanted to create an accessible game bringing everyone to decentralized finance. Unlocking NFTs through MUST staking and increasing your in-game mining capacity could no longer be on Ethereum due to the transaction fees. With this new version on Polygon, the tube is now accessible to all and an almost free cost of use.

**Truly Gamified DeFi**

Gamifying DeFi is an exciting challenge. Join an old mad scientist and experiment with formulas based on MUST. Avoid the wrong dosage of your MUST, be precise in your harvest timing, find the right formulas and you will have access to exclusive NFTs and items.

**A fairer, better balanced and more fun TUBE**

The right balance between improving the new version without harming the positions of our early players was an important challenge for us. A main TUBE allows to stake a lot of Must \(used for Ethereum migration\) and others ‚Äúcapped‚Äù TUBE allows new players and modest **MUST holders** to regularly collect ships and items.

**Introduction of items with the Mining Cooler**![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*XRSTF37JMggHl7SU?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/246/0*XRSTF37JMggHl7SU)

You can now use items in-game. This advantage is for one-time use. We have a long list of ideas and the community will be involved to help us decide in which order to add them to the game. Is your spaceship cool down too slow? Use this amazing **Mining Cooler** to be ready to mine again in the blink of an eye. \(-120sec. on cooldown\)

**Dedicated tubes for each new collection**![](https://miro.medium.com/max/60/0*49r8_VgVWBqR9rrO?q=20)![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1600/0*49r8_VgVWBqR9rrO)

**Each partnership will now have its dedicated tube**. This allows players to implement finer strategies in the distribution of their MUST and thus optimize their fleet in the game.

## Migration from L1 <a id="768a"></a>

> To transfer your DUST in the TUBE on Polygon, you will need to unstake them from TUBE from the TUBE on Ethereum and bridge them through to Polygon.

Once your MUST has arrived on Layer2, **you will need to stack the same amount as on Ethereum** to claim the DUST you previously farmed

You can click on Migrate L1 DUST to see your previously stacked MUST/DUST and get your DUSTv2

To stack your MUST on the TUBE v2, start by approving MUST, then select the TUBE you want to stake must in, select the amount of MUST and click on stake.  
Some TUBEs have a limited Stackable amount of MUST to favor small holders

## The foundations of a future full of innovations <a id="d97c"></a>

With this setting stone, new releases of spaceships and items will happen at a much faster pace. The next big thing will be the beginning of tournaments and Player vs Player arenas which are set to open in the 2nd half of June. Get ready for 4 weeks of tournaments loaded with prizes valued at USD250,000. To enter the tournament, we will leverage our Kiosk and distribute entry tickets in the TUBEüß™ as well. We are finalizing the entry tickets you will be able to redeem in the main TUBE, don‚Äôt waste any time to stake your MUST ‚öó !
