# Tokens \( ⚗️, 🧪 \)

### MUST 

**The MUST ⚗️ token** is an ERC20 utility token that fuels the Cometh Metaverse economics. It is the main game currency of Cometh. MUST can be used to play Cometh, rent spaceship NFTs, stake to mint NFT etc.

As mentioned in the [Rewards section](../../rewards/), there is 2 types of tokens:

1. **Token** rewards: when you mine asteroids charged with single tokens such as **MUST** or **MATIC**, you earn those tokens directly. When you rent spaceships or when someone pull itself to your ships, you earn fixed amounts of token rewards in the form of **MUST.**
2. **LP Token mining** rewards: most asteroids are charged with LP tokens such as **MUST / WETH.** Those LP Tokens represent shares \(%\) of liquidity pools on [ComethSwap](../comethswap/).  They will give you a % of all trades going through those [ComethSwap](../comethswap/) pools and will allow you to [farm for additional yields](../comethswap/).
