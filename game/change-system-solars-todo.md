Move your ship to different solar systems for more opportunities to get rewards.

**Each solar system has its own comets.**

There are currently 3 solary systems, also called: SOL 1, SOL 2 and SOL3.

## How to travel to other solar systems <a id="b6df"></a>

In solar systems, you can find portals.

These portals will allow you to travel to other solar systems.

**Position your ship in the aura of the portal, a notification will appear allowing you to travel.**

> Portals are **faster than spaceships** so you can place your ship in the same orbit and just wait for the portal to reach you.

**Traveling have a cost.** You currently have to pay 0.001 $MUST to the intergalactic toll company.

As initially explained in the [Whitepaper](https://www.cometh.io/cometh-white-paper.pdf), Cometh should have a maximum number of spaceships per solar system. Although no such limit is currently enforced and will be left to the $MUST holderâ€™s governance to decide, it was considered as a starting point to limit to 1,000 both for balancing the difficulty of the game and for performance considerations.
