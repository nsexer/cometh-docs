Move your ship to different solar systems for more opportunities to get rewards.

**Each solar system has its own comets.**

There is currently 3 solary systems, also called: SOL 1, SOL 2 and SOL3.

## How to travel to other solar systems <a id="b6df"></a>

In solar systems, you can find portals.

These portals will allow you to travel to other solar systems.

**Position your ship in the aura of the portal, a notification will appear allowing you to travel.**

> Portals are **faster than spaceships** so you can place your ship in the same orbit and just wait for the portal to reach you.

**Traveling have a cost.** You currently have to pay 0.001 MUST to the intergalactic toll company.

As initially explained in the [Whitepaper](https://www.cometh.io/cometh-white-paper.pdf), Cometh should have a maximum number of spaceships per solar system. Although no such limit is currently enforced and will be left to the MUST holderâ€™s governance to decide, it was considered at a starting point to 1,000 both for balancing the difficulty of the game and for performance considerations.what 1770 Spaceship actively mining looks like.

To reach a new Sol, you need to use the **Portals.**

#### **First find the portal corresponding to the Sol you want to reach.**

#### Then use the portal to travel to your new Sol.

To do so, you have to be on the path of the portal you want to use, and while having **your ship selected**, a notification will pop on the left of your screen to pay for the travel.  
after paying the 0.001 fees, you will travel to your new destination.

> Portals are **faster than spaceships** so you can place your ship in the same orbit and just wait for the portal to reach you.
