Five months after going live on Polygon, Cometh’s groundbreaking DeFi and Gaming applications drove an unprecedented traction:

* More than **4,200 yield generating Spaceship NFT** were minted, bridged and traded between Polygon and Ethereum Mainnet \(average price 0.61 ETH\)
* More than 4,100 unique players did about **4,200,000 transactions** to compete on mining asteroïds and to manage more than 2,100 peer to peer leasing contracts
* Almost **$400,000 rewards distributed to the players**

**This summer, Cometh with the support of** [**Polygon**](https://polygon.technology/) **will reach another order of magnitude and launch the first blockchain based e-sport competition!**

Our thesis is that gaming is the easiest way to understand blockchain and start enjoying all of its benefits, including decentralized finance and digital collectibles. On the 22nd of June we will release the most simple blockchain onboarding ever conceived, getting newcomers on Polygon to grab a wallet, a special edition NFT \(the Mule\) and all the necessary tokens to try out the applications living on [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) scalable infrastructure. From this starting point, the Galactic Academy will make sure these new blockchain users acquire the skills of the new digital age: token swaps, liquidity mining, cryptoeconomics… A dedicated Cometh playground will engage them with ~$1000 in MATIC, MUST and ComethSwap LP per batches of new players.
